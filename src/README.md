# ⚪ madewithcode development

You've found the source code of the [⚪ madewithcode](https://twitter.com/designedcode) framework. Here you can find and manage all the pieces that drive the operating system of turning an hour of time into a consistent output of content.

For so long, it has been difficult to find your place in the social sphere due to your lack of consistency but with an established framework you can extend the life-cycle of content while being able to produce a more vast set at fractions of the financial and capital cost.

## Dependencies

The base of the framework has been built using:

- ⬆️ Vite
- 👁️ React
- 🖼️ Framer Motion

## Creating A New Sandbox

To create the folder for the next day all you have to do is run:

```bash
npm i | pnpm i
pnpm run new
```

This will automatically create a new vite project for you with everything you need done. Once it's created, you will automatically be taken into the directory and you can begin working on the scratch-pad.

## Sandbox Architecture

```ml
src
├─ 000 > 999 - "The home of a daily design."
├─ shared
|  ├─ template - "The template used when creating a new the base of a new day."
```
