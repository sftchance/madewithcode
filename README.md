# ⚪ madewithcode

This repository contains the source code for the daily explorations by ⚪ madewithcode. Serving as a library of knowledge for developers to learn how to implement designs, the majority of content remains open-sourced.

Following a consistent template to make things easy, you can get up and running in just a few seconds.

When learning in a live project:

- 😡 Progress is slow and must be high-quality.
- 😭 Making big changes often has big consequences.
- 🚨 Your whole team needs to know how things work.

But, by learning with the help of the template you:

- 🪄 Can immediately get to the magic of making things look pleasing.
- ✅ Only have to run one command to have a Sandbox experience.
- 🧠 Have the ability to reference the things you learned in previous days.

## Dependencies

The base of the framework has been built using:

- ⬆️ Vite
- 👁️ React
- 🖼️ Framer Motion

## Creating A New Sandbox

To create the folder for the next day all you have to do is run:

```bash
npm i | pnpm i
pnpm run new
```

This will automatically create a new vite project for you with everything you need done. Once it's created, you will automatically be taken into the directory and you can begin working on the scratch-pad.
