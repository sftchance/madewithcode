Following a consistent template to make things easy, you can get up and running in just a few seconds. When learning how to implement design in a live project:

- 😡 Progress is slow and MUST be high-quality.
- 😭 Making small changes often has big consequences.
- 🚨 Your whole team needs to understand.

But, by learning with the help of the template you:

- 🪄 Can immediately get to the magic of making things look pleasing.
- ✅ Only have to run one command to have a Sandbox experience.
- 🧠 Have the ability to reference the things you learned in previous days.

## Dependencies

The base of the framework has been built using:

- ⬆️ Vite
- 👁️ React
- 🖼️ Framer Motion

## Creating A New Sandbox

To create the folder for the next day all you have to do is run:

```bash
npm i | pnpm i
pnpm run new
```

This will automatically create a new vite project for you with everything you need done. Once it's created, you will automatically be taken into the directory and you can begin working on the scratch-pad.
