Following a consistent template to make things easy, you can get up and running in just a few seconds. When learning how to implement design in a live project:

- ðŸ˜¡ Progress is slow and MUST be high-quality.
- ðŸ˜­ Making small changes often has big consequences.
- ðŸš¨ Your whole team needs to understand.

But, by learning with the help of the template you:

- ðŸª„ Can immediately get to the magic of making things look pleasing.
- âœ… Only have to run one command to have a Sandbox experience.
- ðŸ§  Have the ability to reference the things you learned in previous days.

## Days

- #[000](./src/000/) - "Transform cards on enter/exit of viewport with scroll."
